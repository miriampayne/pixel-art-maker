# Pixel Art Maker Project

As part of the Google Developer Challenge, this project's aim is to build out the design.js file to achieve all the interactive elements on the page!

## Tasks

1. Define variables by selecting the DOM elements that the user will interact with. This is where the DOM skills can come into play! For instance, the submit button, the table, and the color picker need to be accessed. The value of the color selected needs to be stored as well, since the clicked cell in the table needs to be set to the selected color.

2. Add event listeners to the relevant DOM elements, so that user input can be color values and table sizes can be dynamically set by the user.

3. Set the size of the cross stitch canvas as an _N_ by _M_ grid with the makeGrid() function. Use your knowledge of JavaScript loops to dynamically clear and create the table based on user input. Each cell should have an event listener that sets the background color of the cell to the selected color.

Now test it! When you're done, you should be able to create a canvas of any size, choose a color using the color picker, and click on the canvas's table cells to set their color.

To complete Pixel Art Maker, you must be using the current version of Edge, Firefox, or Chrome. Due to implementation differences, this exercise does not work effectively in Safari or Opera.
